# PingPong
Pong for CS383


As I have never used Unity before, I leaned quite heavily on others' code for inspiration and for learning.
Main Pong code from Tanay Singhal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oY--Zk9b6w&ab_channel=TanaySinghal
Other Pong ideas from Awesome Inc.: https://www.awesomeinc.org/tutorials/unity-pong/

General help for almost everything: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/

To Play:
Download the zip from Github and extract.
Run PingPong.exe
If Windows says that PingPong.exe is unknown, press more details and press run anyway.

To update (From README Example: https://vandalsuidaho-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jbeeston_uidaho_edu/Documents/CS383/README_Sample_Unity.pdf?cid=2163e130-3a43-4c60-a8cb-bbf5d604dceb):
    Compiling the code
    Updating the code will require a new build. If you do not already have unity installed see the
    instructions below.
    1) Download the .zip file from Github.
    2) Extract the contents of the zipped file into a new file.
    3) Open Unity now or download it at https://store.unity.com/download-nuo
    a. Follow the installation guide all the way through the download.
    b. Once you can start your own project you can continue this guide.
    4) Select the open file option in the top right corner.
    5) Select the file where the zip files were extracted to.
    6) This should open the Unity editor for this game of Pong.
    7) In the top left corner select file -> Build & Run.
    8) Unity will automatically compile everything into the necessary files and create one
    convenient Pong application file that you can click on whenever you would like to play.
    Note Unity creates several other files and folders that must be in the same directory of
    the Pong application for the game to run. 
   
To install Unity (from https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/InstallingUnity.html):
Downloading and installing Unity
Download and install the Unity Editor from the Unity download page. The installer uses a Download Assistant and has detailed instructions to follow.

Unity Download Assistant
The Unity Download Assistant is a small executable program (approximately 1 MB in size) which lets you select which components of the Unity Editor you want to download and install.

If you’re not sure which components you want to install, leave the default selections, click Continue, and follow the installer’s instructions.
